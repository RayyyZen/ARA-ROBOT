<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**ARA-ROBOT** is a C game using the `ncursesw` library, created as part of a school project for the end of the second semester of the first year of preparatory engineering. The game is a **Rogue Lite** where you play as a robot moving through portals within a randomly generated map. Inside these maps, you will encounter **space monsters** that you must either eliminate or try to escape from as they are quite fast. Embark on an adventure and discover numerous **tasks** to complete inside this monster-infested ship.
